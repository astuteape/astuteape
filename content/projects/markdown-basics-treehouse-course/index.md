I structured the course in a way that provided students with a reference sheet they could use in the future. This allowed them to simultaneously learn and create a valuable resource.

The full course exists behind a paywall; however, you can [view a sample on Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/markdown-basics), and [view the course project on GitHub](https://github.com/treehouse/cheatsheets/blob/master/markdown_basics/cheatsheet.md).
