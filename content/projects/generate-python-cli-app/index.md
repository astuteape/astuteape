As a digital content producer, I must stay organized. This means folders—a lot of folders.

To automate some of the tedium, I wrote this CLI app using Python. It generates a project folder structure that you define and reuse. A more feature-rich version of this app is used multiple times each week to automate video project creation at Treehouse.
