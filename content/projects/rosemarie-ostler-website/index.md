Rosemarie Ostler is a linguist and freelance writer living in Eugene, Oregon. She wanted a simple website that would work well across modern devices.

She had previously created a site using her own HTML and CSS skills. She wanted to maintain her new site going forward while avoiding a more comprehensive solution such as Squarespace, Wix, or WordPress. For these reasons, I developed a hand-coded site that she could maintain on her existing host.

I tried to keep the JavaScript to an absolute minimum. I relied on CSS3 animations to provide some visual polish.

Because the site makes little use of photos and graphics, I color blocked elements and played with the color theming throughout.
