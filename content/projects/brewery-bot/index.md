BreweryBot was a Facebook Messenger bot that helped people find breweries near them.

I used TypeScript, Express, Wit.ai, Google Geocode API, Google Places API, and the BreweryDB API to deliver a real-time chat experience. The asynchronous nature of the app required a dive into JavaScript promises and asynchronous programming.

Due to my general unease with Facebook and its data practices, the bot is no longer live. However, the video above shows it in action, and you can [view the code on GitHub](https://github.com/astuteape/brewery-bot)
